# 💻 Personal Portfolio - kxtfn.xyz

Hi, I'm Igor aka Evil aka kxtfn 👾 
This is my personal portfolio site made from scratch for the sake of learning, practicing and showing myself as an aspiring frontend developer. The site will gradually be improved and updated with new items.

---

## 🌐 What's on the site?

- 🧠 Information about me
- 🎨 A bit about creativity (drawing, resourcepacks, music)
- 🛠 Projects and ideas
- 📖 Blog (in the future)
- 🧪 Virtual PC lab (in progress)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **React** + **TypeScript**
- **CSS** (hand styling, no UI libraries)
- **Git** + **GitHub** - version control

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

I was involved in creating a simple virtual lab for college, but decided to develop my own version completely from scratch.  
I want to make it more clear, visual and interactive - with smooth animations, adaptive interface, division into modules and support for extensions in the future.
